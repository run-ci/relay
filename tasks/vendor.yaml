summary: Vendor Go dependencies.

description: |
  Go ignores the vendor folder by default when building
  with modules. This means that for every run of the build-*
  tasks, all the project's dependencies will need to be
  downloaded.
  
  To avoid this, the local tasks can use the vendor folder
  if you choose to download it with this task.

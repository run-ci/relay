# These keys follow the default conventions used by the YAML package.

# The data must be associated in the YAML file so that when it's loaded
# it can all be processed in the correct order. This is necessary because
# there's no way of knowing some foreign keys, like IDs, beforehand. The
# only way to know that a git remote belongs to a project is by associating
# it with that project directly, until that project is saved in the database
# and has an ID to formalize the association with.
